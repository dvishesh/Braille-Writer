# Braille-Writer
an embedded application that uses the LPC1769 LPCExpresso board with an ARM Cortex-M3 processor and LPCOpen Libraries along with accelerometers by FreeScale to implement a physical glove capable of detecting simultaneous finger taps, interpreting them as Braille alphabets and then translating and displaying them as text digitally.

Will provide specs of peripheral hardware used in due time.
